# Welcome to my second task currency converter from PLN to EUR!

Hi! This is my second homework done for the YouCode course. I will be grateful for any feedback and I am asking for your understanding. 

Link to my website: [Homepage](https://machloy.github.io/Currency/)

## Description

This is a simple site that was "homework" in a course in which I am a participant.   
The website is written in simple HTML, CSS also JS. It's supposed to work, not look (at least for now).
